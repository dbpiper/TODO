# UI Designs
The UI design has the following goals:
* 1-2 taps for most frequent activites
* Familiar (to desktop users) where possible
* Intuitive

The design proposals described below attempt to meet all these goals.

## UI Design V1.0

### Main Screen
The main screen is shown below.

The actionbar has text and it is the title of the app. This displays the
brand of the app and lets users know what the app is supposed to do.

The main content of the screen is the list of items that need to be completed.
Each item has the title of the todo item at the left and the due date (if any)
at the right.

There is a floating action button at the bottom right of the screen
which is used to add new items.

### Add Item Screen
The add new item screen is shown below.

The actionbar has a back button which is used to navigate back to the
Main Screen. The actionbar also has an editable text-field for making
the title of the todo item.

Underneath the actionbar is a editable text-field for adding the description
of the todo item.
